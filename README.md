# Teamwork Chat Plug-in for Franz

A simple plug-in for Teamwork Chat.

Logos are from Teamwork's official press media kit so I guess using them here
is okay. Any copyright of course belongs to them.

### Usage

This is currently not in Franz' main channel so to install the plug-in you have
to copy **the contents of this folder** (not the folder itself!) to

* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Franz/recipes/dev/teamwork-chat`
* Windows: `%appdata%/Franz/recipes/dev/teamwork-chat`
* Linux: `~/.config/Franz/recipes/dev/teamwork-chat`

and restart Franz.

If you chose hosting your Teamwork team in the EU you will have to add the
`.eu` part of the URL as part of the team name.
